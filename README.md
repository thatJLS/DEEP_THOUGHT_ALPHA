# DEEP_THOUGHT_ALPHA

Hey friends, my name is JLS and this is the official repository for DeepThought version Alpha, an open-source VLA foundation model developed for robotics applications. The model is designed to take distilled versions of top LLM's and application-specific AI models (both closed-source and open-source) while interfacing with GRID, an all-in-one, extensible, open-source alternative to NVIDIA Isaac Lab and NVIDA GROOT. DeepThought Version Alpha will be used as the foundational model for GP-0 and ID-0, which are physical prototypes of Advanced Automatons' GP-1 and ID-1 Androids (release target: Q2 2030)

DeepThought version Alpha will include the following featues for use with GP-0 and ID-0, either by distilling other existing implementations or implementing custom solutions:
- Converational Capabilities (OpenAI Conversational State API)
- User-Personalized Database Capabilities 
- Analysis from internal/external sensors (vision system, physical manipulation system)
- Physical Maniuplaiton/Navigation (GRID intrgration)

WHAT TO COPY: Xpeng VLA 2.0
