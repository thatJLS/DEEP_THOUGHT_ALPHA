# DEEP_THOUGHT_ALPHA

Hey friends, my name is JLS and this is Deep Thought 0.1 Alpha, a fully open-source model built from the ground up using VLT (Vision-Language-Transformer), VLA (Vision-Language-Action), and VLM (Vision-Language-Models). This project is designed for use with prototype models of Advanced Automatons Androids to be integrated with GRID, a souped up version of NVIDIA Issac Lab and Project GROOT. If you're interested in the project, send me an email: officialJLS@proton.me.
