# DEEP_THOUGHT_ALPHA

Hey friends, my name is JLS and this is the official repository for DEEP_THOUGHT_ALPHA, an open-source foundation model leveraging advanced LLM distillation techniques to develop an all-inclusive foundation model for advanced humanoid robotics appliations. The plan is to distill ChatGPT 5.0, Gemini 2.5 and Nvidia Issac Lab/Issac Sim into one model, preventing hallucinations as much as possible, I understand that what I am proposing is a herculean task, especially for an unincorperated startup with limited funds but I believe this is the only way I'll be able to leapfrog my competition in order to become one of the most successful startups in Silicon Valley. 
If you're interested in joining me on this journey, send me an email at officialJLS@proton.me. This is JLS, signing off.
